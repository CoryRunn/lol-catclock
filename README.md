My very first JavaScript project from Skillcrush.com!

Here's a silly and fun JavaScript project done through Skillcrush.com. This project was a way to start getting familiar with how JavaScript works. The html and css were provided and the JavaScript was written by myself (with guidance from a tutorial).

It mainly consists of using objects, properties, functions, methods, variables, and DOM elements.
